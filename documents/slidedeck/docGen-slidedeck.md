## Need for documentation

 - We prefer writing code

 - **BUT** asynchronous knowledge sharing has VALUE

 - DRY principle: easier to write once then say it a lot


## Use simple files

 - Document THOUGHTS and DECISIONS, not how the code works

 - Developers like to keep documentation close to the code

 - Flat text files are great

 - Most WYSIWYG processors are slow to work with

 - LaTeX syntax is convoluted

## DocGen Stack

 - Ubuntu Linux

 - Pandoc + TexLive

 - Some template libraries

 - Some MD editor. I use NeoVim

## Automate the boring stuff

 - Markdown to PDF
 - Avoid setting up entire machine
 - Can be added to build pipeline

## Give it a go!

  - **Try it out, and let me know what you think!**
